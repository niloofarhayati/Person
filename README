Installation & Running
Use the package manager maven to install and run. You'll also need Java 8 as JVM.
First build the project and run tests with the command :
mvn clean install
and then
mvn spring-boot:run
to run my backend

Usage
For added Problem to Solve I choose Securing my API:

So the API usage needs Authentication, for POST, PUT, DELETE Requests Role of admin with user:admin password:password
for GET requests Role of USER with user:user password:password
1) Create a Person (POST REQUEST)

Use Postman or another tool such as curl to make a POST request

curl --header "Content-Type: application/json"
--request POST
http://< host >:< port >/savePerson

and you will get a response containing the newly generated person id.

2) update person (PUT REQUEST)

curl --header "Content-Type: application/json"
--request PUT
http://< host >:< port >/persons/id

3) get Person or persons( GET REQUEST)

curl --header "Content-Type: application/json"
--request GET
http://< host >:< port >/persons/id or 
http://< host >:< port >/persons

4) delete person ( DELETE REQUEST)

curl --header "Content-Type: application/json"
--request DELETE
http://< host >:< port >/persons/id
